# Retina Caffeine

I modified [a retina assets](https://github.com/bkenny/retina-caffeine) for the popular Mac App [Caffeine](https://itunes.apple.com/ie/app/caffeine/id411246225?mt=12) for both normal and dark menu bar on Yosemite.

## Introduction

I found this assets via [a post](http://macnews.tistory.com/2732) on a famous korean mac blog and realized the assetes is not yet prepare for dark mode on Yosemite.
In my mac, [the f.lux app](https://justgetflux.com) automatically change the color of menubar by time, so I need a new assets which should be viewable on both colors.
I changed the color of @bkenny's assets from the black to the grey which is dimmed but viewable yet.

## Installation

Just download these files and place them in:

```
/Applications/Caffeine.app/Contents/Resources
```
